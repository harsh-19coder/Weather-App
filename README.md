# Weather-App
A Weather App project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is designed to provide users with real-time weather information and forecasts for various locations. The app fetches data from a weather API, displaying details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The front end is built with HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and data handling. Users can search for locations, view current weather conditions, and see forecasts. This project demonstrates skills in web development, including responsive design, API integration, and dynamic content updating, making it an excellent tool for learning front-end web technologies.
